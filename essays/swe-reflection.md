# Reflections on ICS 414: Building for the Real World

## Introduction

This past semester in ICS 414 has been one of the most hands-on experiences in my academic journey. It gave me the chance to step outside the textbook and build something that could actually be used in a real-world setting. Our project centered around developing a web application for accounting firms, a tool that takes Excel spreadsheet data and turns it into clean, role-based visual dashboards for auditors, executives, and administrators.

### From Excel Sheets to Graphs: Building Something Useful

We started by identifying a real need: accounting firms needed a better way to interpret spreadsheet data quickly and securely. So, our team built a system that could read Excel files, process the data, and display it through graphs tailored to specific user roles. Admins could manage everything, while auditors and executives would only see what was relevant to them. This made the app feel personal and professional at the same time.

### Working Together and Learning Deployment

One of the highlights of the semester was learning how to collaborate effectively in a development team. We used GitHub to manage our code and Vercel to deploy our app. It was the first time I had seen a project go live on the web, and it was incredibly rewarding. Seeing how small changes could be pushed and immediately reflected online made development feel fast and real.

### Challenges and Growth

Not everything was smooth. There were technical challenges, especially around handling user authentication and making sure the right people saw the right data. But those roadblocks pushed me to dig deeper into backend logic, secure routing, and frontend design. Just as importantly, I learned the value of asking questions, checking in with teammates, and iterating on feedback.

## Conclusion

ICS 414 helped me grow both technically and personally. I came away with stronger development skills, a better understanding of team collaboration, and confidence in building something from scratch that people might actually use. This project is now a solid part of my professional portfolio, and I am proud of everything we accomplished together this semester.
