### Unexpected Change
Becoming a software engineer was never on my radar until recently, just a few years back. Back in high school and early college, I was set on the path of civil engineering. I was captivated by the idea of using physics to build tangible structures, so I focused my coursework in that direction. However, as I got deeper into physics and calculus-based majors during college, I realized that they didn't quite align with my true interests. It was in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that I had an epiphany, prompting me to explore my passions more deeply.

## Learning 

During this period of self-discovery, I decided to learn how to code. The idea of creating something using the power of computers had always fascinated me, and it was a revelation that I could engineer through lines of code. While I'd always had a keen interest in technology, I never thought it would become a central pillar of my future career.

## Progress...?

As I progressed through the handful of software engineering courses I've taken thus far, I've come to realize that I've barely scratched the surface of this vast and ever-evolving field. My hunger for knowledge and my passion for solving problems have only intensified. I'm committed to digging deeper, exploring novel approaches to problem-solving, and discovering innovative ways to build websites and applications. My ultimate goal is to reach a level of coding proficiency where I can confidently say that I am skilled in this craft, making it a fundamental part of my professional identity. What draws me to software engineering isn't just its limitless potential but also the continuous journey of learning and growth it offers.

## One Day

My venture into the world of software engineering has been a thrilling exploration of my evolving interests, leaving me genuinely excited about the skills and experiences that lie ahead. For me, it's all about mastering programming, diving into the realm of application development, and refining my ability to work well with others and effectively communicate complex ideas. These are the crucial building blocks that I see as essential in shaping my journey through the ever-changing landscape of software engineering.
