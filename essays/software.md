*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

Becoming a software engineer was never on my radar until recently, just a few years back. Back in high school and early college, I was set on the path of civil engineering. I was captivated by the idea of using physics to build tangible structures, so I focused my coursework in that direction. However, as I got deeper into physics and calculus-based majors during college, I realized that they didn't quite align with my true interests. It was in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that I had an epiphany, prompting me to explore my passions more deeply.

## In the context of programming

During this period of self-discovery, I decided to learn how to code. The idea of creating something using the power of computers had always fascinated me, and it was a revelation that I could engineer through lines of code. While I'd always had a keen interest in technology, I never thought it would become a central pillar of my future career.

## In the context of engineering

As I progressed through the handful of software engineering courses I've taken thus far, I've come to realize that I've barely scratched the surface of this vast and ever-evolving field. My hunger for knowledge and my passion for solving problems have only intensified. I'm committed to digging deeper, exploring novel approaches to problem-solving, and discovering innovative ways to build websites and applications. My ultimate goal is to reach a level of coding proficiency where I can confidently say that I am skilled in this craft, making it a fundamental part of my professional identity. What draws me to software engineering isn't just its limitless potential but also the continuous journey of learning and growth it offers.


## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
